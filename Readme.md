jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript. You can use it to add interactivity and other dynamic features to websites, and it is also often used to simplify common tasks such as making an AJAX request to a server.
